        <h1><span>FIBO Products</span></h1>

        <h2>
          <strong>FIBO</strong> is intended for a range of uses, including in
          its simplest form as an English language glossary or a bank or
          regulator's data dictionary. In its most complex form,
          <router-link :to="{ path: router('OWL') }"
            >FIBO in its native Web Ontology Language (OWL)</router-link
          >, could be used as a bank's operational ontology. There are also
          external uses of FIBO, such as FIBO.schema.org, which use FIBO as a
          reference for search indexing of specific information on the Internet.
        </h2>

        <h3>FIBO OWL</h3>
        <p>
          Although FIBO can be seen as a "product family", it is primarily an
          OWL ontology. FIBO OWL, both in its Production and Development
          versions, is availableÂ <router-link :to="{ path: router('OWL') }"
            >here</router-link
          >. The FIBO OWL is best viewed using
          <router-link :to="{ path: router('ontology-tools') }"
            >dedicated ontology tools</router-link
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>FIBO derived products</h3>
        <p>
          FIBO is also available as derived products. All FIBO products are
          generated or derived with an automated process from the
          <router-link :to="{ path: router('OWL') }">FIBO OWL</router-link>.
          Thus all changes in the FIBO OWL will be reflected in all other
          products. We are making all of FIBO available now because we have
          already seen amazing work done with FIBO and we welcome, almost
          demand, your feedback:
