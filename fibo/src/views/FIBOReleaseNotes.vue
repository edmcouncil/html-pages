                <h3 id="2021Q4"><strong>2021 Q4</strong></h3>
                              <h4>Revisions Summary by Elisa Kendall</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter we made significant progress across domain areas, as summarized below.  New production concepts include those related to rights and warrants as well the concept of a master agreement in contracts.  Concepts related to organizational 			structure were promoted to the main organizations ontology, and our representation of legal entity-related concepts is more aligned with updates made by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).  We also made significant progress in areas including corporate actions and asset-backed securities, though we have not yet promoted the relevant ontologies to release status (planned for 2022).  We also updated the ISO 10383 MIC codes and FpML interest rates to the latest released versions.</p>

                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter’s revisions in business entities were limited to migration of high-level concepts related to organizational structure from BE to FND and correction of a few typos in definitions and notes.  FIBO users should be aware that although we have deprecated the concepts in BE in favor of their replacements in FND, we will likely eliminate the deprecated elements over the course of 2022.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ABE+">All 2021 BE Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Business Process Domain (BP)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter the domain of business processes remained stable.</p>

                <h4>Corporate Actions and Events (CAE)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter we initiated work to clean up and extend the securities-specific corporate actions ontology, to move corporate actions that are more general in scope and reflect changes at the legal entity level to a new corporate actions ontology in the CAE domain.  We anticipate augmenting this ontology over the coming months to cover the range of entity level actions that the Global Legal Entity Foundation (GLEIF) and ISO 20022/15022 identify such that the codes used by either standard can be mapped to common definitions.  We will also be extending the existing securities oriented corporate actions ontology to cover more of ISO 20022/15022, and moving the codes themselves into separate reference data ontologies to conform to the approach we have taken for reference data elsewhere in FIBO.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ACAE+">All 2021 CAE Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Our primary achievement this quarter was to revise and promote RightsAndWarrants to release status. We also addressed a number of “leftover” issues related to Options and other derivatives ontologies, including improved representation of exercise terms, and fixing a few inconsistencies and typos that we noticed during testing.  Finally, we cleaned-up definitions in the swaps individuals ontology as a part of the process of normalizing our overall identifier hierarchy (see FBC for more details).</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ADER+">All 2021 DER Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                              <p class="text">The primary accomplishment in FBC in Q4 involved restructuring and eliminating inconsistencies in the identifier hierarchy, eliminating odd inheritance structures, clarifying the nature of a registry identifier, and cleaning up issues related to LEI data so that our reference individuals and examples are better aligned with what is published by the GLEIF.  We will continue to review and align with the latest GLEIF ontologies and plan to publish a mapping ontology over the coming months to provide FIBO users with a precise way of integrating the GLEIF data published at data.world with FIBO in their local knowledge graphs. We also revised the ISO 10383 Market Identifier Codes (MIC) to incorporate the latest changes published by ISO, i.e., as of 14 December 2021.  Other changes this quarter include correcting a couple of bugs, fixing typos, and addressing side-effects of moving some of the organizational structure concepts from BE to FND.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFBC+">All 2021 FBC Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">The most important changes made in FND in Q4 include incorporating concepts related to organizational structure in the main organizations ontology (originally in BE) and adding the concept of a master agreement to the contracts ontology. We also addressed a number of smaller outstanding issues that had accumulated over time.  These included improving definitions related to rights under legal construct, clarifying the definition of a legal document, reconciling properties related to ownership with the situational pattern, improving the identifier hierarchy as noted in FBC, and fixing typos. We anticipate further work to augment the definition of a master agreement over the coming months with additional concepts such as a master services agreement and brokerage agreement, which will be further elaborated with respect to the concept of a master ISDA agreement in DER.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFND+">All 2021 FND Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Most of the revisions made in Q4 were related to corporate actions (see CAE).  With basic concepts related to market indices covered, we are now working towards answering competency questions around the impact of corporate actions on those indices.  We also revised the common interest rates individuals to reflect the latest changes to FpML reference rates.  This was a major change that incorporated the 2021 updates to FpML.  Note that some rates are now deprecated, corresponding to their deprecation in the original FpML rates.  We will continue to include them in FIBO until they are eliminated from FpML.  Other changes in IND include side-effects of the identifier hierarchy revisions, bug fixing and addressing typos.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AIND+">All 2021 IND Q4 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter the domain of loans remained stable.</p>


                <h4>Market Data Domain (MD)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter the domain of marked data remained stable.</p>


                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter we spent significant time reviewing concepts related to asset-backed securities.  This is an area that has been relatively untouched to date, though last quarter we merged some ontologies and eliminated circular dependencies.  Focus to date has been on refining the top-level pool-backed securities ontology, which we plan to release in Q1 2022.  We also addressed some issues in the bonds hierarchy, notably adding support for certain index-linked bonds, addressed side-effects of other issues and fixed typos.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ASEC+">All 2021 SEC Q4 PRs and Issues</a>   


                <h4>Hygiene tests</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter we extended the set of hygiene tests with the check for OWL 2 illegal punning. In fact, it is a composite check, which we split into 6 separate SPARQL queries - see all checks with 1624 infix in their names.
                              In addition we refactored all other checks so that they ignore all deprecated resources (in the sense of the owl:deprecated property.)</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021+Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3Ahygiene+">All 2021 hygiene Q4 PRs and Issues</a> 

                <h3 id="2021Q3"><strong>2021 Q3</strong></h3>
                              <h4>Revisions Summary by Elisa Kendall</h4>
                              <p class="text">The primary focus this quarter was on releasing additional derivatives ontologies, including currency contracts and commodities contracts, and in cleaning up and consolidating the provisional asset-backed securities ontologies in preparation for further work. We also spent some time reviewing provisional corporate actions with the intent to separate business/legal entity oriented actions from security-specific corporate actions and preparation for releasing ontologies reflecting both classes of corporate actions soon, updated the ISO MIC codes, and addressed various other minor clarifying issues.</p>

                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                               <p class="text">This quarter the Business Entities domain area remained stable, with no revisions.</p>

                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                              <p class="text">In Q3, the DER content team formalized and released two ontologies: CurrencyContracts and CommoditiesContracts.  In preparation for releasing those ontologies we also cleaned up concepts specific to spot contracts and integrated them as a general notion into the FinancialInstruments ontology in FBC.  Other revisions included clean-up of the remaining SecurityBasedDerivatives with an eye towards releasing EquityForwards next quarter.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ADER+">All 2021 DER Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Changes related to FBC this quarter were due to changes initiated in (1) SEC with respect to refining the notion of time to maturity and adding a number of market classifications to the markets ontology, (2) DER, to integrate spot contracts in the main financial instruments ontology, and (3) IND, in support of refining definitions of baskets related to market indices.  We also updated the ISO MIC codes to reflect the latest updates from ISO and to incorporate the additional market classifications, providing further classification of the markets specified in the ISO standard.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFBC+">All 2021 FBC Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter the Foundations domain area remained stable, with a handful of changes to annotations for clarification as needed based on work in other domain areas.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFND+">All 2021 FND Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Much of the work accomplished this quarter in IND involved background research on corporate actions, which we will continue to work on next quarter.  One issue with respect to representation of the S&P 500 as an example market index was resolved, however.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AIND+">All 2021 IND Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Minor changes to the provisional LoanEvents ontology were made this quarter to clean up concepts and add properties related to legal proceedings with respect to default events.  The intent is to continue clean-up work next quarter with the potential for releasing the primary core loan ontology.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ALOAN+">All 2021 LOAN Q3 PRs and Issues</a>


                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                              <p class="text">The majority of the work performed this quarter was related to asset-backed securities.  A number of provisional ontologies were merged, renamed and the architecture revised to conform to the overall strategy used elsewhere in FIBO.  We also eliminated some amount of duplication in properties to better integrate the ABS ontologies with other parts of FIBO and cleaned up a number of definitions and annotations.  There is still significant work to be done before these ontologies can be released, but the effort completed this quarter will be quite useful going forward, such that we can begin to release these ontologies either later this year or early next year.  Other minor changes included clarification of definitions for time to maturity, bill of exchange, and dividend related concepts.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ASEC+">All 2021 SEC Q3 PRs and Issues</a>


                <h3 id="2021Q2"><strong>2021 Q2</strong></h3>
                              <h4>Revisions Summary by Elisa Kendall</h4>
                              <p class="text">The most important change this quarter is the release of the Options ontology by the DER FCT. In addition, the SEC FCT released the depositary receipts ontology, and new international jurisdictions and government entities for Asia are now available in BE (5 ontologies), which are essential to KYC, AML and regulatory reporting use cases. Other updates include better integration of situational patterns for ownership and control, new Canadian tax authorities and identifiers in FBC, new classes supporting naming patterns that can be used to address interoperability, data lineage, and related requirements in FND, and bug fixing as needed.</p>

                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter’s notable revisions for business entities included restructuring high level ownership and control relations to better reflect patterns implemented in FND over the last several months for situational knowledge. We also updated our reference data for jurisdictions to include Asian jurisdictions at the country level, for all independent countries identified in the U.N. M49 as being part of the continent of Asia. We anticipate adding Oceania and Africa over the coming months, which will give us complete coverage of jurisdictions at the country level as needed for regulatory reporting, KYC, AML, and other use cases.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021+Q2+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ABE+">All 2021 BE Q2 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Our primary achievement this quarter was to revise and promote the Options ontology to release status. The effort, which we initiated in Q1, included moving some concepts related to exotic options to a new ExoticOptions provisional ontology, which we will address over the coming months. We also merged some concepts related to currency contracts into a single ontology, which we moved from a subordinate module into Derivatives Contracts, again provisionally, but stay tuned for that to be released over the coming months. We also cleaned up the provisional commodities ontologies as part of that effort.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021+Q2+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ADER+">All 2021 DER Q2 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                              <p class="text">FBC mainly played a supporting role to changes that propagated from securities and derivatives this quarter. Some tweaks reflected revisions to the situational pattern changes in BE, minor bug fixes, and a few issues identified through work on the newly released options ontology related to pricing. We also integrated tax identifiers for Canadian business entities with the assistance of new FIBO users who needed them for their application this quarter.</p>
                              <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222021+Q2+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFBC+">All 2021 FBC Q2 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">Like FBC, changes to FND in Q2 were mainly related to (1) further refinements of the situational pattern for ownership and control, (2) minor bug fixes, and (3) changes that propagated from securities and derivatives. Notably, we added new classes for reified names, including Name in Agents and ContextualName in Parties, which allow for aggregation of various properties such as name prefixes and suffixes for people, and most importantly, support user extensions for pedigree, provenance, and data lineage related to names. We also simplified the hierarchy involving independent parties, people, and organizations, thereby reducing confusion that some FIBO users had identified.</p>

                <h4>Hygiene tests</h4>
                              <p class="text">The only changes to hygiene tests this quarter involved clean up of some duplication, and clean-up of the test descriptions in the ontology guide.</p>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                              <p class="text">This quarter most of the changes to IND ontologies involved bug-fixes identified through usability testing. The IND ontologies are relatively stable at this point, and we have met a number of the goals set out in our IND use cases. Next steps for IND will focus on corporate actions, and the impact such actions have on various indicators. We will be developing additional examples as a consequence, as well as further testing our time series representation not only for market rates but for economic indicators.</p>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                              <p class="text">There were no changes to the provisional loan content this quarter. We anticipate ramping that effort back up so that we can release the provisional LoanCore and LoanApplications ontologies soon, however.</p>

                              <p class="text">The most visible change made to securities this quarter was finalization and release of the depositary receipts ontology in SEC/Equities. Other changes included (1) addressing downstream impacts of the changes related to the situational ownership and control patterns, (2) addressing the downstream impact of eliminating the confusion between independent parties, people, and organizations, (3) clean-up of equivalences related to the legal structure of a fund and common shares, (4) correcting logic issues in the provisional CIV ontology, and (5) addressing a gap related to the number of shares outstanding for any class of shares.</p>

                <h3 id="2021Q1"><strong>2021 Q1</strong></h3>
                <h4>Revisions Summary by Elisa Kendall</h4>
                <p class="text">This quarter we made significant progress across domain areas, as discussed below. One major accomplishment is that although we’ve added many new hygiene tests, especially in the last several months, we’ve also eliminated all of the errors in the production ontologies using those tests. In other words, there are NO remaining hygiene errors in the production ontologies. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t any issues, of course, just that for the set of tests we have automated to date, the production FIBO ontologies are error-free. We will continue to add to that arsenal of tests which will likely find more issues, but with 21 tests today, we believe that the contributions of any community member are much more likely to be of higher quality that they would be otherwise.</p>

                <p class="text">New production concepts for credit facilities, additional common contract clauses, futures, and forwards are now available. We’ve also updated the ISO 10383 MIC codes and FpML interest rates to the latest released versions. And, we now have an exhaustive set of classes representing the ISO 10962 CFI codes for common and preferred shares.</p>


                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                <p class="text">This quarter’s revisions were primarily syntactic, with a handful of exceptions. We updated our reference data for jurisdictions in general to handle language-specific diacritic and other special characters properly, revised references that were no longer available, eliminated remaining circular definitions, and addressed other hygiene issues. One interesting change involved revising the jurisdiction reference data for the European Union to reflect Brexit. We also added a new <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/OwnershipAndControl/Executives/CorporateBylaws">CorporateBylaws class</a> including a restriction related to hasAuthorizedShares; added a property for hasNominalValue, and used that property in a new top-level restriction on financial instruments to address use cases we are working on in securities and derivatives.</p>

                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                <p class="text">Our primary achievement this quarter was to revise and promote FuturesAndForwards (formerly called Forwards in the DerivativesContracts module) to release status. We made significant revisions to the provisional Options ontology with an eye towards release in Q2, including merging exchange-traded options with over-the-counter options ontologies, whose features largely overlapped, better integration of the options content with other released ontologies, and started reviewing, cleaning up, and extending the remaining content. This work involved refactoring across a number of the provisional ontologies in derivatives, including significant clean-up in any that were related to options or forwards/futures. Some concepts/properties were moved “higher up the food chain”, to DerivativesBasics or to FBC, depending on the situation, mainly for reusability purposes. It is likely that we will extract content specific to exotic options from the main ontology as we move towards releasing the main options ontology for better modularity and ease of use. As part of our clean-up effort, we also merged some of the small asset class-specific ontologies to aid usability and reduce overhead related to maintenance costs. Finally, we eliminated all remaining hygiene issues in the released ontologies.</p>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                <p class="text">Notable revisions to FBC this quarter include (1) integration of the provisional credit facilities ontology with the debt ontology and thus promoting that content to release status, (2) integration of the provisional communications ontology content with reporting in FND and loan applications in Loans, with some impact to FBC but mainly FND, (3) revised the ISO 10383 MIC codes to reflect the latest ISO publication, (4) migration of PromissoryNote from Contracts in FND to Debt in FBC, integrating it with the new credit facility concepts, and (5) revised references that were no longer available, eliminated remaining circular definitions and other hygiene issues. We also made a few changes to the provisional settlement and instrument pricing ontologies to reflect requirements bubbled up through securities and derivatives.</p>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                <p class="text">Important revisions in Q1include integration of concepts from the informative AgreementsExt module reflecting contractual commitments into contracts, and elimination of the informative module. Other changes involved minor updates supporting various other domain areas, and addressing syntactic issues, including revising references that were no longer available, eliminating remaining circular definitions, and resolving other remaining hygiene issues. We also revised content related to use cases from other domain areas, for example, merging what was the provisional communications ontology into other released ontologies to minimize maintenance overhead and support consistency.</p>

                <h4>Hygiene tests</h4>
                <p class="text">In Q1 we've introduced four new hygiene tests:</p>

                <ul>
                        <li>a test <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1289.sparql">testHygiene1289.sparql</a> that searches for object properties that may be isA impostors. The search looks for object properties whose local names: are identical to 'isA' string, start with 'may' string and contain either 'become' or 'also' strings,</li>
                        <li>a test <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1290.sparql">testHygiene1290.sparql</a> that finds all top-level classes outside FND, FBC, and LCC domains,</li>
                        <li>a test <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1292.sparql">testHygiene1292.sparql</a> that find classes that refer to multiple concepts by means of the logical constructs of conjunctions and disjunctions,</li>
                        <li>a test <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1293.sparql">testHygiene1293.sparql</a> that searches for the min 1 cardinality restrictions - both qualified and non-qualified.,</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text">Three hygiene tests: <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene0114.sparql">testHygiene0114.sparql</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1289.sparql">testHygiene1289.sparql</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/blob/master/etc/testing/hygiene/testHygiene1290.sparql">testHygiene1290.sparql</a> have been promoted to prod errors.</p>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                <p class="text">Most of the revisions made in Q1 were driven by testing, cleaning up some minor issues we discovered, and eliminating issues uncovered through expanded hygiene testing. One notable change is that we updated the FpML reference interest rates to reflect the latest version. We also extended the definition of volatility to include implied and historical volatility, which, as it happens, are critical to understanding when reflecting on issues related to recent developments in the markets such as the Archegos debacle.</p>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                <p class="text">This quarter we continued the clean-up work we have been doing in LOANs, and integrated the now released credit facility concepts, allowing us to merge/eliminate another provisional loans ontology (LoansBasicTerms).</p>

                <h4>Developer Guide (DG)</h4>
                <p class="text">Changes to the CONTRIBUTING.md file mostly concerning new community spaces.</p>

                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                <p class="text">In Q1 we continued our focus on the representation of preferred shares, and on building out the exhaustive set of classes needed to fully model the ISO 10962 CFI standard with respect to common and preferred shares. That effort is now complete, using multiple inheritance to expand the flattened hierarchy included in the ISO standard, and we anticipate continuing that process to add the exhaustive set of classes for representing convertible common and preferred shares in Q2, as well as coverage of limited partnership units. Other changes reflect the further revision of concepts related to Bonds, such as a better representation of zero coupon vs. OID bonds, the distinctions related to call vs. put, maturity dates, and so forth, so that the same concepts could be used across bonds and preferred shares. Finally, we eliminated all remaining hygiene issues in the released ontologies.</p>

                <h3 id="2020Q4"><strong>2020 Q4</strong></h3>
                <h4>Revisions Summary</h4>
                <p>A number of ontologies were created and/or promoted to release status this quarter. These include</p>

                        <ul><li>security-based derivatives and equity swaps, </li>
                                <li>funds, which have been moved from their own CIV domain to SEC/Funds, and (3) new government entity and jurisdiction ontologies for Central and South America as well as a start on Asian entities (Eastern Asia).</li></ul>

                <p>Additional areas of significant effort stemmed from support of the EDM Council's AML working group (new legal entities, new relationships under ownership and control, streamlining of relationship patterns for better query and reasoning results), and changes identified through our ongoing use-case based example work, including clean-up and extension of provisional derivatives and corporate actions ontologies.</p>


                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                <p>This quarter's updates include further additions to the set of government legal entities, governments, and jurisdictions FIBO covers, including Central and South America as well as Eastern Asia.  We anticipate completing the Asian entities and jurisdictions in Q1 of 2021 and will incorporate Oceania and Africa over the coming months.</p>

                <p>Also, this quarter we supported work going on in the EDM Council's AML working group by adding legal entities, such as limited liability companies and improving on our representation of trusts, adding other relationships and identifiers covering tax authorities, and streamlining control relationships, such as for beneficial ownership, and integrating their properties into our party patterns.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q4+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ABE+">All 2020 BE Q4 PRs and Issues</a>


                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                <p>Our primary achievements this quarter include the promotion of two derivatives ontologies into production: Security-Based Derivatives and Equity Swaps.  These new ontologies reflect months of work in the DER working group, where we also merged a number of smaller ontologies, eliminated duplication across a number of derivatives provisional ontologies, and initiated another round of work on Forwards and Options.</p>

                <p>We plan to continue work on commodity swaps as well as on forwards and options in Q1 2021, and hope to release at least one of those ontologies by the end of Q1.  Users should be aware that we will likely be merging more small ontologies in derivatives as we work through this process.  </p>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                <p>This quarter the FBC working group focused largely on supporting other FIBO working groups through adding legal entities -  Association, Development Bank, Money Services Business, Mortgage Company, Registered Investment Advisor, and so forth.  Other notable revisions include updates to the MIC codes to reflect changes published by ISO, and revision of all of our reference and example LEI URIs and related data to conform with the new reference data published by the GLEIF on data.world.</p>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                <p>Work on Foundations this quarter mainly involved continued simplification in areas such as the contract party hierarchy and additions of explicit concepts, such as DateOfBirth and DateOf Death, in support of the EDM Council's AML working group.</p>

                <h4>Hygiene tests</h4>
                <p>This quarter we extended the set of hygiene tests on:</p>

                <ul>
                        <li>hygiene test for class hierarchy cycles</li>
                        <li>hygiene test for property hierarchy cycles</li>
                        <li>hygiene test for direct circularity in owl imports</li>
                        <li>hygiene test for dots in local names of FIBO classes and properties</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Test for ambiguous definitions (i.e., the definitions that include 'or') has been removed. The test was supposed to find ambiguous definitions, but it turned out to produce a number of false positives.</p>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                <p>This quarter the IND working group focused mainly on clean-up and supporting other working groups. One notable achievement includes significant clean-up of the provisional corporate actions (CAE) ontology in support of our use case involving management of market indicies and how they change over time.  We plan to continue the work on corporate actions based on our IND use cases in Q1 2021, and hope to release the securities-specific corporate actions ontology by the end of Q2.  FIBO users should be aware that the securities-specific CAE ontology, which covers the relevant events but not message content, may be moved to a new sub-domain of SEC, but is still in its own domain for the time being.</p>

                <h4>Ontology Guide (OG)</h4>
                <p>Test candidate T6. "Partial modeling" has been removed from the ontology guide.</p>

                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                <p>This quarter the SEC working group continued work initiated earlier this year on the equities ontology to improve the representation of preferred shares and address issues uncovered in representing static data for listings and shares more generally, including new examples.</p>

                <p>In addition, we moved what was a separate CIV (and special purpose vehicles) domain area under Securities.  The original domain included one CIV ontology, which we've largely retained, but is now SEC/Funds/CIV.rdf.  The new SEC/Funds module actually includes two ontologies: a high-level Funds ontology, released this quarter, as well as the remainder of the original CIV ontology, which we plan to work through over the coming months.  We anticipate that at least some of the content of the CIV ontology will move to the new Funds ontology as we work with example data and further flesh out some of the details.</p>

                <h3 id="2020Q3"><strong>2020 Q3</strong></h3>
                <h4>Revisions Summary</h4>
                <p>This quarter we made progress in a number of areas, as outlined below.  A number of new ontologies and extensions of others, including additional jurisdictions, merchant category codes, security-based derivatives (provisional), credit cards (provisional), market indices, and preferred share representation are included in the release.</p>

                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                <p>This quarter’s BE updates include extensions to FIBO’s representation of government entities and jurisdictions, which now cover all countries in North America and Europe, including the devolved government entities in the U.K.  We expect to integrate entities and jurisdictions for all countries represented in ISO 3166 over the coming months.  We also added support for ISO merchant category codes this quarter, which are important for credit card transactions, among other use cases.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ABE+">All 2020 BE Q3 PRs and Issues</a>


                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                <p>The focus in derivatives over the quarter is reflected primarily in the development (provisional) area, rather than on fully released ontologies. The FIBO DER working group has refactored the development class hierarchy related to security-based derivatives (formerly called asset derivatives, which some of our users found confusing).  We have streamlined some of the content defining equity and debt security (bonds, for example) based derivatives, and will be releasing some of this work in Q4, as it matures enough to do so.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ADER+">All 2020 DER Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                <p>Notable revisions to FBC this quarter include (1) alignment of concepts related to accounts and account-specific properties with the new situational pattern (see FND), (2) release of the credit events ontology, in support of our indicators use case, and (3) new support for credit cards and credit card accounts, which we needed to complete the mapping to schema.org.  The credit card ontology is provisional, but we plan to release it as it matures over the coming months.  We also generalized representation of redemption provisions for securities in response to requirements for preferred share representation in SEC.  </p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFBC+">All 2020 FBC Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                <p>Most of the work performed in FND this quarter bug fixing and content clean-up.  A Important revisions include: (1) elimination of redundancies and confusion with respect to the date/time and quantities ontologies, (2) refactoring of some domain/range definitions, unions “on the righthand side” of some axioms, and restrictions that force FIBO to be outside of OWL RL (ongoing work that we hope will make FIBO more usable with commercial rule engines), (3) simplification of the dependencies included in some ontologies to make them more reusable, and (4) introduction of a new set of situational patterns to allow more sophisticated representation and querying of time-sensitive relationships across FIBO.  The new situational patterns, which include ownership and control, streamline and extend FIBO’s ability to connect the dots between parties via the roles that they play under various circumstances, using a number of new property chains.  By overlaying our existing ownership-specific relations with these new patterns and eliminating non-compliant properties and restrictions, not only are we seeing better results in some FIBO user applications, but we’ve reduced the reasoning overhead in many of our domain areas by 10% to 25%.  This streamlining work will continue over the coming months to complete the changes with respect to control relationships, among others, and augment FIBO with new relationship patterns as they are identified by our use cases.</p>

                <h4>Hygiene tests</h4>
                <p>This quarter we extended the set of hygiene tests. Some hygiene tests were refactored.</p>

                <h4>Indicators and Indices (IND)</h4>
                <p>Changes in Q3 addressed two areas: (1) to extend the representation of various populations related to unemployment to better support some of the content published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Statistics Canada, and other countries about changes in the workforce (e.g., tracking the underemployed and people employed part-time for economic reasons, discouraged and marginally attached population), and (2) release of the market indices ontology, including examples such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500.  The changes in employment population representation were motivated by the dramatic changes in employment due to the COVID pandemic.  The examples we’ve included regarding market indices show how to model the value of an index and its constituents, but are not exhaustively complete.  Next steps include integrating more details about the constituents of an index, such as how changes in the value of a given constituent impact the value of the index.</p>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                <p>This quarter we continued streamlining and merging some of the content in LOAN, which will be an ongoing effort over the coming months in preparation for a new working group in this area.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q3+FIBO+Release%22+label%3ALOAN+">All 2020 LOAN Q3 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Ontology Guide (OG)</h4>
                <p>This quarter the Ontology Guide was updated with information about new hygiene tests. Some clarifications were added regarding the PROV-O ontology.</p>

                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                <p>This quarter the SEC working group focused mainly on extending the equities ontology to provide better representation of preferred shares.  Other changes included revision of our representation of a ticker symbol so that the same symbol can be reused over time as well as represent listings on more than one exchange, and a few bug fixes in Bonds.</p>

                <h3 id="2020Q2"><strong>2020 Q2</strong></h3>

                <h4>Business Entities (BE)</h4>
                <p>This quarter we've leveraged the new Situation pattern introduced in Foundations (FND) to begin to rationalize, refactor, and simplify concepts and properties related to ownership and control.  Although more work is needed to complete the process, especially involving control relations, the results have enabled a number of nice consequences in reasoning over our examples (mainly represented in FBC) related to ownership, parent organizations, and the like.  We've also added more capabilities related to linking board members, corporate officers, and other authorized persons such as signatories to the organizations they support, which will allow us to create more interesting graphs showing how people are strategically connected across businesses.</p>

                <h4>Derivatives (DER)</h4>
                <p>We've integrated an example interest rate swap contract based on notional data provided by Mizuho and included some preliminary clean-up of provisional ontologies.</p>

                <h4>Financial Business and Commerce (FBC)</h4>
                <p>This quarter we've updated the ISO MIC codes to reflect the June 2020 published codes and cleaned up a few issues uncovered in testing.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo/issues?q=milestone%3A%222020+Q2+FIBO+Release%22+label%3AFBC+">All 2020 FBC Q2 PRs and Issues</a>

                <h4>Foundations (FND)</h4>
                <p>Aside from clean-up related to issues identified through other work, we've added the concept of a situation, which allows us to connect context, including time, location, and other characteristics, to relationships between various parties.  We've also built out the set of 'lattice' properties relating roles and the parties that play those roles in any situation, which is the basis for cleaning up ownership and control relationships, and adding new ones, going forward. </p>

                <h4>Loans (LOAN)</h4>
                <p>This quarter we've continued to integrate some of the legacy, provisional loans ontologies, merging a number of them and moving concepts around as appropriate, in preparation for launching a new loans working group later this year.</p>

                <h4>Metadata (META)</h4>
                <p>Changes this quarter are primarily to address bugs identified through testing of our deployment processes.</p>

                <h4>Securities (SEC)</h4>
                <p>Primary changes in this release involved revising the equities ontologies to enable support for the ISO CFI classification scheme, including examples.  We've completed an initial pass for common shares, and will be working on preferred shares and other equity concepts as well as bonds over the coming months.  We also integrated a new pricing ontology, which leveraged work in provisional ontologies and has been tested with example shares we've added.</p>

                <p>Q1 2020 activities were primarily use case driven. We have added a number of examples, in BE to provide individuals representing companies the issue shares, in FBC to augment those individuals with GLEIF LEI registration and other details, in SEC to add examples representing shares those companies issue, and in IND to show how to integrate the information about those shares in an index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Additional work included clean up / merging of content that was in informative ontologies, better integration with the OMG Languages, Countries, and Codes (LCC) standard to eliminate redundancy (which we already depended on), and address bugs raised by the community.</p>

                <h4>Foundations</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>

                <p>Most of the work performed in FND this quarter involved integration and/or elimination of informative ontologies that were largely duplicative or unused (and in need of complete refactoring / replacement). Important revisions include: (1) the elimination of classes and properties that duplicated concepts in LCC – all were replaced with the LCC equivalent, (2) revision of the address hierarchy and related concepts and properties, including migration of a number of properties from FBC to FND, elimination of unnecessary subclasses in BE and FBC, and support for the US Postal Service Publication 28, which is a US-specific address standard for addressing used by many countries for shipping, and (3) revision of the definition and hierarchy of asset, to align more closely with US GAAP and IFRS accounting definitions. As a result of the work done this quarter, there are only a handful of informative ontologies remaining in FND (and FIBO in general), 1 related to contracts and a number of transaction-specific ontologies. We anticipate merging/integrating these and a few additional provisional ontologies remaining in FND over the course of Q2 2020.</p>

                        <li>FND-290 - adds two new annotation properties for common and preferred designation, which are needed for the US postal address extensions, corrects the representation of 3 individuals for maturity level by declaring them properly as named individuals, updates other definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, and corrects a bug with respect to the modifiedOn annotation to declare the Dublin Core 'modified' property, which is not declared in the OMG's specification metadata and should have been declared herein as a consequence</li>
                        <li>FND-290 - completes the set of secondary unit designators in the addresses ontology so that they are declared in the same namespace, thus simplifying the US extension that uses them</li>

                        <li>FND-290 - eliminate unnecessary '-SFX' from Key and Trailer, since they are in separate namespaces from the secondary unit designators with the same name; add the US postal address ontologies to the BE North American all file</li>

                        <li>FND-294 - this iteration takes a different approach, eliminating the hasLocaleDesignation property in favor of a region-specific identifier, and then adding the appropriate identifiers for the US states and territories and Canadian provinces</li>

                <h4>Indices and Indicators</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>

                <p>Two major updates were completed in Q1 with respect to IND: (1) revision of the strategy for representation of interest rate benchmarks, such as those published as FpML reference interest rates, and (2) significant work towards releasing market indices, including examples such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500, among others. The work was largely the outcome of our use case work on market indices, and represents the first step among many needed in this area. The examples provided allow us to demonstrate how to model the value of an index and its constitutents, whose current stock values and market cap we can now represent. The next step will be to integrate more details about the constituents of an index, including how changes in the value of a given constituent impact the value of the index.</p>

                <h4>Loans</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>

                <p>This quarter we spent some time to begin to ‘coagulate’ loans, to quote Dennis and Michael Uschold, who worked on the LOAN FCT for many months, ending roughly a year ago. The goal is to take the work to the next level so that it can be released for use by the community. Work completed this quarter was just the starting point, but lays the groundwork for additional ‘coagulation’ and integration over the coming months.</p>

                <h4>Securities</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>

                <p>Most of the work this quarter built on use case work completed at the end of last year, towards demonstrating how to represent individual equities in FIBO. We started with the basic information available in OpenFIGI, and then augmented that with some of the listing information we found in various sources online. The goal of the securities use case is to be able to represent instrument master data in FIBO, for which we now have the most basic details. The examples are now available in the released version of FIBO, and include the set of equities we use in IND to demonstrate how to represent the constituents of the DJIA. Other issues we resolved were primarily things we noticed along the way. </p>

                    <li>FND-225 hasNotionalAmount Expanded explanatory note to describe a wider range of potential uses of this property for different instrument types, based on available sources, and corrected it from wrongly being styled as an editorial note. Restyled the definition to capture the essential intended nature of this relationship, removing the near-circularity in which nominal was substituted for notional in previous drafts.</li>
                    <li>FND-225 Revision to proposed definition in FND-225 (remove redundant account of monetary amount) and addition of explanatory note for usage of this concept in derivatives markets.</li>
                    <li>FND-225 updated definition of hasNotionalAmount to remove circularity, using suggested wording in place of the offending part of the definition and retaining the rest, in FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount</li>
                    <li>FND-229 Modified definition of the class CurrencyIdentifier in FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf to remove the word trigraph. Also made the definition more generic, to reflect the class as framed by the DL assertions, and changed from the definite to the indefinite article. Modified the explanatoryNote to indicate that this is specific to the kind of CurrencyIdentifier which is an ISO 3166 Currency Identifier. Change to definition in line with recommendation on the pull request comments</li>

                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>
                <p>Changes this quarter were mainly to support the IND-EFT-DEV use case, the goal of which is to support representation of market index data sufficient for analytics by financial institutions that monitor various indices and their make-up internally, that manage various funds based on those indices, and so forth. The revisions include, but are not limited to: adding support for weighted baskets and weighting functions, further work on representing filters for baskets, and preliminary development of examples that FIBO users can leverage to build out internal models for index analysis and management.</p>

                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>
                <p>Changes this quarter were made primarily in support of the SEC-02 use case, the goal of which is to support representation of instrument data for market traded instruments, for regulatory purposes, for decision making, or for portfolio management. The use case specifically targets the subset of security master file data that might be published by an exchange. Revisions include, but are not limited to: differentiating the concept of a security from a listing of that security, representation of additional key properties of listings, cleaning up definitions and terminology that has been superseded by recent work, and adding a preliminary example that we can use for further testing and as the basis for more revisions in Q1.</p>

                <p>In 2019 Q2, we released a new web site. It still points to the same products, but now with a styling and look-and-feel that is more in alignment with the main EDMC website.</p>

                <h4>Business Entities</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>
                <p>This quarter&rsquo;s BE updates were primarily (1) migrate remaining, relevant content that was originally in informative BE ontologies to various other ontologies (and thus eliminate the remaining obsolete informative ontologies), and (2) fix reasoning errors related to government entities.</p>
                <p class="text"></p>
                <p class="text"><em>Detailed Changes</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BE-202 - eliminated references to BE/FunctionalEntitiesExt ontologies now that their contents have been merged into other ontologies as appropriate</li>
                    <li>BE-202 - integrated content from informative ontologies in BE/FunctionalEntitiesExt into the ontologies where those concepts were used</li>
                    <li>BE-203 - eliminated reasoning error which was caused by two separate but somewhat related issues: (1) an extra blank node in a reasoning loop for definining a government minister in unnecessary restrictions and (2) the fact that there were two ways to get to the same individual defining the legal entity for the government body, which is fine, but there were two tags on it as a result, and hasTag was incorrectly defined as being functional. If you can get to an individual that has a tag in more than one way, it can't be functional. And, anything that can be identified by more than one identifier could inadvertently also run into this problem. (#727)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>FBC-103 - added the definition of exempt security, which is required for some of the definitions in the bonds and traded short-term debt ontologies, to financial instruments and made a registered security disjoint with exempt security (#717)</li>
                    <li>FBC-221 - addressed feedback received in GitHub comments</li>
                    <li>FBC-221 - moved certain registration authority individuals from primary business registries and markets ontologies to a new international individuals ontology to support better modularity and improve reasoning performance when they are not required (time for reasoning with HermiT over the primary ontologies in FND, BE, and FBC, without individuals, was reduced from 30+ minutes to just under 3 minutes as a result)</li>
                    <li>FBC-221 - revised the ontology name from International Financial Organizations to International Registries and Authorities to better reflect its scope</li>
                    <li>FBC-223 - cleaned up logic issues in securities identification individuals, eliminating reasoning issues, adjusted definitions for ISO 704 compliance and added missing definitions</li>

                <p>Most of the work performed in FND this quarter involved integration and/or elimination of informative ontologies that were largely duplicative. However, there were a few changes of note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the addition of new assessments and ratings ontologies, which are now released,</li>
                    <li>the addition of a new combined date time datatype that is useful for mapping knowledge graphs to back-end data stores whose representation of dates and times is inconsistent, and</li>
                    <li>the addition of identifiers associated with certain identity documents in support of data privacy and knowledge graph integration/interoperability use cases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text"></p>
                <p class="text"><em>Detailed Changes</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>FND-240 - loosens the restrictions on certain date time properties to use the new combined date time datatype or its equivalent and as appropriate for representation of acquisition dates and times, sale dates and times, any member of a dated collection, such as a series of dates related to prices in a yield curve, etc.</li>
                    <li>FND-240 - loosens the restrictions on certain date time properties</li>

                    <li>FND-244 - additional commits to finalize elimination of the policy ontology</li>
                    <li>FND-244 - eliminate and/or move references from business goals in the BusinessExt module to other locations where they can be widely used; migrate concepts including hasObjective and BusinessObjective from the LegalPersons ontology to Objectives in FND to facilitate reuse of those concepts more broadly, with primary requirements related to investment objectives and others required for disclosures, risk, fund-related definitions, etc.</li>

                    <li>FND-246 - augmented the definition of identity document, birth certificate, driver's license and passport to be identified by specific identifiers rather than just have a tag associated with them to enable queries supporting GDPR and other privacy laws</li>
                    <li>FND-246 - eliminated references to the Publications ontology from these 3 ontologies, and changed 'terms set' to 'terms' where it appeared, in line with the naming we've used in the released ontologies, also reduced some of the duplication in properties</li>
                    <li>FND-246 - this commit includes the changes mentioned - i.e., integrating identification schemes</li>
                    <li>FND-248 - cleaned up additional redundancy, references to informative ontologies, and ambiguity where possible</li>
                    <li>FND-248 - corrected hygiene issues</li>
                    <li>FND-248 - eliminated all references to the FND/MathExt/Amounts ontology, including revision of embedded definitions that leveraged concepts from Amounts, such as MD/TemporalCore TimedNumericAmount and a few other time-specific concepts; Note that there is significant work remaining to eliminate the TimeExt and MathExt remaining ontologies, which are on the roadmap but out of scope for this issue resolution</li>
                    <li>FND-248 - eliminated references to the FND/MathExt/Quantities ontology, which was used only in one place and added no value</li>

                    <li>FND-251 - eliminate the informative physical ontology, which was only used by other informative ontologies and included concepts that were too abstract to be required in any released ontology (#723)</li>
                    <li>FND-252 - addressed missing definition for hasExerciseTerms</li>
                    <li>FND-252 - corrected hygiene issues (missed references)</li>
                    <li>FND-252 - eliminated references to PublicationsExt in exchange traded options ontologies; merged exchange traded options, options exchanges, and options standardized terms to eliminate circularities and duplications</li>
                    <li>FND-252 - eliminated references to the PublicationsExt ontology in DER/ExchangeTradedDerivatives futures ontologies, and eliminated circular dependencies between the 3 futures ontologies by merging them, eliminating a number of duplicate properties, reusing concepts from the DerivativesBasics ontology</li>

                    <li>FBC-212 - determined that one of the issues with the individuals was related to the identifiers for banking functions, which were originally organization identifiers, thus causing all functional entities that had such identifiers to be inferred to be formal organizations (introducing a logical inconsistency); added a new financial service provider identifier that is determined by function, corrected a restriction in control parties, referenced the new identifier and eliminated redundant restrictions in US regulatory agencies and used (and tested) the fix with US financial services entities individuals and added new content to reflect the revised BE entity ownership properties</li>
                    <li>FBC-214 - added USMarketsAndExchanges to the metadata for FBC Functional Entities (eliminated an erroneous imports statement)</li>
                    <li>FBC-217 - revised MIC codes as of February 11 2019</li>
                    <li>FBC-218 - revised MIC codes to support the March 11, 2019 ISO published codes</li>
                    <li>FBC-219 - eliminated all remaining explicit range restrictions using rdfs:Literal in the range, in qualified cardinality restrictions (made unqualified), and a couple of cases that were missed</li>
                    <li>FBC-219 - loosened range restrictions on names to rdfs:Literal to allow for either xsd:string or rdf:langString (i.e., language tagged strings), enabling multilingual representation of names of entities</li>

                    <li>FND-235 - renamed the datatype from composite date value to combined date time, per FND FCT discussion, and eliminated the corresponding property</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated support for GLEIF LEI Level 2 accounting consolidation relationships and made other revisions with respect to GLEIF LEI representation to better support automation of reference data and reflect the nature of the GLIEF published information with respect to entity legal forms</li>
                    <li>Simplified the hierarchies involving formal organizations and legal entities substantially, including deprecating 'formally constituted organization' and 'juridical person', and adding the latter as a synonym of 'legal entity'</li>
                    <li>Clarified the distinction between a natural person and legally competent natural person</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text"></p>
                <p class="text"><em>Detailed Changes</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BE-195 - moved the restriction that an entity may be identified by a legal entity identifier from LEIEligibleEntity to LegalPerson and deprecated LEIEligibleEntity as a part of organization hierarchy simplification</li>
                    <li>BE-181 - replaced 'natural person' with 'legally competent natural person' across ontologies where that concept was required</li>
                    <li>BE-181 - added a new class to replace 'natural person', called 'legally competent natural person', for the sake of clarity</li>
                    <li>BE-181 - deprecate legally capable person in favor of natural person, which includes a more general definition of the concept of legal competence. Legal competence is jurisdiction and situation specific - in some jurisdictions, people that are under the age of 'maturity' can apply for jobs, can enter into contracts, are considered competent to make certain decisions for themselves in a court of law, etc. For the purposes of FIBO, legal competence generally means that an individual can take on liabilities, such as taxes on earnings, or fees associated with an account, or potentially take on a debt, or own property or join the military. The revised definition of natural person includes the concept of liability capacity and is jurisdiction specific. Merging these two concepts in favor of natural person simplifies the conceptual representation and hierarchy and clarifies what is intended.</li>
                    <li>BE-180 - as a part of the organizational hierarchy simplification, replaced uses of FormallyConstitutedOrganization with either FormalOrganization, LegalPerson or LegalEntity, as appropriate, across FIBO domains</li>
                    <li>BE-180 - merged the concept of FormallyConstitutedOrganization with LegalEntity in BE, given that the definitions were almost identical and that FormallyConstitutedOrganization simply added complexity without significant value to the organizational hierarchy</li>
                    <li>BE-180 - replaced references to FormallyConstitutedOrganization with FormalOrganization from FND, which eliminated a number of out-of-domain references in FND informative ontologies</li>
                    <li>BE-180 - merge the definitions of legal entity and juridical person to simplify the legal persons and organizations hierarchies; make Polity a child of GovernmentBody, again to simplify the hierarchy</li>
                    <li>BE-178 - revised the definition of supranational entity to use the definition from ISO 20275, added adapted from the ISO standard</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - revised property naming from parent / child to direct ownership and investment, loosened certain ownership relationships to allow business entities (including sole proprietorships), legal entities, and not for profit organizations (such as certain foundations used for tax purposes primarily) but not ownership of people (i.e., broader than legal entity but not as broad as legal person)</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - added a relationship period qualifier and made active and inactive relationships status individuals of that qualifier, revised definitions accordingly; reorganized the two individuals of relationship status so that the status itself is at the end of the name and revised definitions to be closer to the GLIEF definitions for these status indicators; simplified names of consolidatation related properties</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - added new records property to Documents to allow a record to reference the thing that it is recording</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - added restriction on entity ownership for relationship classifier (which would cover the information relevant to the time frame for the relationship)</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - loosened constraints on properties in Contracts - is evidenced by and is evidence for; slight revisions to representation in ownership parties based on testing</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - added a couple of missing concepts, revised restrictions after review of test data</li>
                    <li>BE-156 - initial version of a revised entity ownership reified relation for the purposes of GLEIF level 2 support</li>
                    <li>BE-141 - added synonyms for code sets (also addresses FBC-172)</li>
                    <li>BE-141 - added the registry / registry entry for entity legal forms; added the entity legal form identifier and scheme, as well as individuals for ISO 20275 code set and ISO 17442 code set (LEI)</li>
                    <li>BE-114 - added explanatory note indicating that a license may also be an agreement or contract, depending on the license and jurisdiction</li>
                    <li>BE-141 - moved restriction on hasLegalFormAbbreviation to EntityLegalForm; added new property hasTransliteratedLegalFormAbbreviation and other restrictions to EntityLegalForm to correspond to the GLIEF ELF standard</li>
                    <li>BE-114 - modified the parent of License from Agreement to LegalDocument, which is more appropriate (all licenses, including fishing licenses, business licenses, and software licenses are legal documents, but not necessarily agreements since they are often unilateral)</li>
                    <li>BE-141 - deprecated hasLegalFormAbbreviation in Corporations per BE-141; moved it to LEIEntities where the actual legal form is referenced and added the hasLegalFormAbbreviation and restriction there in parallel with the reference to the actual legal form</li>
                    <li>BE-115 - revised the definition of power of attorney to eliminate a restriction that the authoritiy is limited to the lifetime of the principal; moved some of the content to an explanatory note, added another source and a restriction that it has an effective date (in most cases, not all, thus min 0)</li>
                    <li>BE-110 - modified the definition of responsible party to correspond to its intended usage, i.e. with respect to people rather than organizations as well as people</li>
                    <li>BE-88 - generalized the parents of beneficial owner to be beneficiary and owner; revised the definition to move an explanatory component out to an explanatory note, updated annotation properties as appropriate</li>

                    <li>FBC-194 Add municipalities (auto-generated) referenced in ISO 10383 MIC codes, that are not included in FpML business centers, as of the 2018-09-11T15:57:43 publication of the ISO 10383 MIC codes on the ISO web site</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - revised business centers, including all of those processed automatically from FpML (a couple still need tweaking and 3 business day adjustments to be added)</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - revised individuals to add business days for certain entities and business centers; eliminated unneeded references in the markets and exchanges individuals</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - modified approach to representing cities as parts of subdivisions rather than as subdivisions of subdivisions to get desired reasoning results</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - initial pass at encoding FpML business centers, starting with those in the U.S.</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - revised the definition of holding company to be a child of functional business entity rather than business, which is more appropriate given the function of a holding company</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - revised business dates to allow the property, has business center, to be used by more than the class called business day adjustment; revised the definition of business day adjustment to allow for the same adjustment to apply to multiple business centers (also agrees with the FpML specification); added a new ontology called business centers in FBC to support the set of FpML business centers, required for specifying the business center in which a given exchange operates</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - added general holding company to certain organization definitions</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - created the notion of a generic holding company, needed to represent the structures present in the various exchange corporate hierarchies</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - modified the relationship between market segment and the operating level market it is a part of; changed the reference from operatesInCity to operatesInMunicipality (strings to things) to allow us to reference FpML business centers</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - see prior comment re: definitions, the addition of New York Stock Exchange LLC, etc.</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - added market segment-level and operating level markets under exchange; eliminated "individual representing" from various definitions, added New York Stock Exchange LLC and revised other definitions accordingly</li>
                    <li>FBC-194 - deprecated the class called "market" and made market a synonym of exchange; added exchanges to the example exchanges and markets in the US</li>
                    <li>FBC-117 - broadened the definition of underwriter in financial services entities to cover insurance, mortgage, securities, and other kinds of underwriters and did the same with underwriting arrangement; revised the definition of security underwriter in securities issuance to correspond to the regulations better and added security underwriting arrangement such that there is a parallel structure for securities with the structure in FBC, as a guide to addressing mortgage underwriting in loans</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text"><em>Highlights</em></p>
                <p>The revisions to SEC content this quarter include minor changes to released ontologies as well as significant development of some of the content in provisional debt instruments planned for release in 2019:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated 6 SEC/Debt/Bonds ontologies into a single coherent ontology, eliminating circular references between them</li>
                    <li>Eliminated redundant content in SEC/Debt/DebtFoundations and SEC/Debt/MoneyMarkets and moved the resulting ontologies, including 'traded short-term debt' and 'exercise conventions' to the SEC/Debt level and moved remaining concepts that were not redundant into the SEC/Debt/DebtInstruments ontology or to other provisional ontologies under LOAN, DER, or SEC/Debt/AssetBackedSecurities</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text"></p>
                <p class="text"><em>Detailed Changes</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SEC-75 - clean up some of the labels and definitions, add missing definitions (not all, just some per the concepts relevant to FINRA), bridge a few properties to the proper concepts in the debt instruments ontology, etc.</li>
                    <li>SEC-75 - correct label and definition on has scheduled maturity date</li>
                    <li>SEC-71 - completed integration of CallEvent as a RedemptionEvent in DebtInstruments and eliminated the related axiom in Bonds</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - eliminate circular reference to traded short term debt in the TimeExt/Time ontology as well as unused notions related to up to one year and more than one year durations</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - eliminate references to the TimeExt/Time ontology from exchange traded options to facliltate minimal clean up of the TimeExt/Time ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - renamed MoneyMarketDebtInstrument to MoneyMarketInstrument, which is the name it is commonly known by; eliminated the equivalence in that class and made various other instruments children of money market instrument given that the set included in the union was incomplete (so the logic would disallow other kinds of money market instruments), revised the definition to use one from the OECD Glossary (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - eliminated asset repurchase agreement and liability repurchase agreement as they are not used in the relevant literature (though there are kinds of REPOs missing from this ontology)</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - eliminate references to the TimeExt/Time ontology in Debt/DebtFoundations, Debt/MoneyMarkets, and Debt/AssetBackedSecurities, and merge the small REPOs ontology into TradedShortTermDebt</li>
                    <li>SEC-67 - eliminated additional redundancy in the TimeExt/Time ontology related to business day conventions and business calendars made moot by recent changes to import all FpML business day conventions and business centers in FBC (and due to their lack of usage by anything else)</li>
                    <li>SEC-65 - revised metadata for the SEC/Debt/AssetBackedSecurities module to reflect the name change</li>
                    <li>SEC-65 - renamed the module called "AssetBacked" to "AssetBackedSecurities" to align with FIBO naming conventions and per SEC-65; modified URIs in all ontologies that reference anything in this module accordingly</li>
                    <li>SEC-63 - corrected namespace prefix on TreasuryBill</li>
                    <li>SEC-63 - eliminated the domain of hasTypicalDurationToMaturity which seemed too narrow</li>
                    <li>SEC-63 - revised the range of hasTypicalDurationToMaturity to be the same as it's parent property and added a definition for it</li>
                    <li>SEC-63 - eliminated circularity in TradedShortTermDebt, refined content, and moved it to SEC/Debt; updated references to it, and eliminated the MoneyMarkets subdomain</li>
                    <li>SEC-62 - moved the contents of the term deposits ontology to clients and accounts in FBC; revised the definitions related to 'term deposit' according to regulatory definitions provided by the FDIC, which regulates deposit accounts in the US, and whose definitions other countries rely on as the source for the same or similar concepts</li>
                    <li>SEC-61 - moved LoanParticipationNotes to AssetBackedSecurities, noting that it is (1) lacking concepts about loan participation (which small and medium sized banks do to spread risk for a given loan that is larger than what they can or want to commit funds to), which should be in loans, and (2) a basic syndicated loan, typically issued to a large company and which is a very large loan, again used to spread risk across institutions, which should also be in loans, where this ontology includes the concept of a security based on a syndicated loan</li>
                    <li>SEC-61 - eliminated the redundant hasUnderlying property (given that it is in derivatives and has access to that property) from participation notes and moved it to DER/DerivativesContracts</li>
                    <li>SEC-60 - corrected prefix for FloatingInterestRate and added a definition to hasNotificationProvision</li>
                    <li>SEC-60 - eliminate the remaining DebtCashflowTerms ontology and related DebtFoundatations metadata file</li>
                    <li>SEC-60 - move remaining properties in DebtCashflowTerms to their proper homes</li>
                    <li>SEC-60 - corrected restriction with respect to repayment date</li>

                    <li>SEC-60 - eliminate remaining references to the DebtCashflowTerms ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-60 - revised payment schedule to use occurrence rather than occurrence kind (i.e., payment), added property has payment schedule to support integration of debt, debt cashflow terms, and loans</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - normalize spelling of issuance programme using 'mme' spelling specifically due to its appropriateness and usage in this case from the domain perspective</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - clean up remaining content from DebtFoundations/DebtIssuanceTerms and move it all to BP/SecuritiesIssuance/DebtIssuance where it is used</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - eliminate references to debt issuance terms in mortgage-backed and pool-backed securities</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - additional redundancy elimination in Debt Issuance Terms</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - moved terms from Debt Issuance to Asset backed SPVs where they were used and started eliminating duplication in Debt Issuance Terms related to bonds</li>
                    <li>SEC-59 - eliminated references to securities issuance SPV in participation notes (extends issuer which is already inherited via a restriction, and the need for that level of specificity overly complicates the model), eliminated unused references to other ontologies</li>
                    <li>SEC-56 - eliminate the now redundant DebtInstrumentGuaranties ontology and revise module metadata accordingly</li>
                    <li>SEC-56 - moved the bond insurance class from debt instrument guaranties to bonds common, since bond insurance can impact pricing</li>
                    <li>SEC-56 - clean up and move most of the non-redundant contents of the DebtInstrumentGuarantees ontology to the Guaranty ontology in FBC/Debt</li>
                    <li>SEC-55 - moved relevant restrictions from DebtFinance to the various loan and asset-backed securities ontologies where they belong, and then eliminated references remaining to the DebtFinance ontology and finally eliminated the ontology itself</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminated now redundant DER/DerivativesContracts ExerciseConventions (replaced with SEC/Debt/ExerciseConventions or concepts moved to Options)</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate now redundant STRIPs and Bonds metadata ontologies</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - integrated basic concepts related to strips and revised the metadata to account for the migration of bonds to the higher level Debt ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate restriction error in DebtPricingYields (this was there previously, perhaps highlighted by corrections in the bonds ontology)</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate references to the DER/DerivativesContracts/ExerciseConventions ontology and replace them with the revised SEC/Debt/ExerciseConventions ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - integrated a new exercise conventions that can be used both in SEC/Debt and DER/Options; but have not integrated/replaced those concepts that are duplicate in DER yet</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate redundancies in DebtInterestAmounts due to migration of concepts to Bonds</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate all of the SEC/Debts/Bonds/ ontologies that have been merged into the higher level Bonds ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - replace all uses of any SEC/Debt/Bonds/xxx ontology with the merged SEC/Debt/Bonds/ ontology if it occurs outside of SEC/Debt/Bonds</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminated additional references to informative ontologies, integrated certain concepts from those ontologies, eliminated additional redundancy and circular internal references</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - streamlined certain names based on approach taken elsewhere in the released ontologies, e.g., TermsSet --&gt; Terms; merged content from MD/DebtTemporal/DebtInterestAmounts into bonds which is where they belong, e.g., BondCoupon and it's children</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminated tax-related concepts per the SEC FCT on-line review, additional duplication and some references to informative ontologies</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate references to informative Math ontology</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - eliminate unnecessary references to BP - IssuanceProcessTerms (provisional / informative)</li>
                    <li>SEC-42 - Bring all of the bonds ontologies, which involve many circular references, together into a single ontology with a common prefix, etc. (aside from STRIPs)</li>
                    <li>SEC-34 - revised property hasJurisdiction to use the new hasCoverageArea property instead</li>
                    <li>SEC-18 - declare the three individuals of relative price all different from one another</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
                <h4>FBC</h4>
                <p>Integrated reference data for FpML business centers and ISO 10383 MIC Codes, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>corrected long dashes in some Nordic auction on demand markets and related codes</li>
                    <li>corrected prefix on US states in business centers individuals</li>
                    <li>corrected the following references for municipalities: Ebene_City --&gt; Ebene, Frankfurt_Am_Main --&gt; Frankfurt, Klagenfurt_Am_Woerthersee --&gt; Klagenfurt_am_Woerthersee, New_Jersey --&gt; Summit, Nicosia_lefkosia --&gt; Nicosia, S-hertogenbosch --&gt; s-Hertogenbosch, Saint-petersburg--&gt; Saint-Petersburg, St__Peter_Port --&gt; Saint_Peter_Port, and Washington_new_York --&gt; Washington_New_York</li>
                    <li>eliminated references to non-existent markets for codes for XXXX, BILT, and XOFF</li>

                    <li>fixed additional issues in the generated codes, e.g. characters that were not proper in URIs, ampersands that were not escaped, etc.</li>
                    <li>relaxed restriction on exchange name so that we can map detailed individuals that reflect the nature and other facts about an exchange to the generated content</li>
                    <li>revised market identifiers to correct various issues</li>
                    <li>corrected business centers that were modeled to be in Taiwan that are actually in India</li>
                    <li>eliminated parent of 'has' on 'has municipality'</li>

                    <li>added a property for hasMunicipality to allow registration addresses to incorporate a business center or municipality as a first class object rather than strictly as a text string (as in hasCity); both are needed for cases where some city has not been represented as a municipality individual in FIBO (although geonames could be referenced as an alternative source, as desired)</li>
                    <li>revised business centers, municipalities, and markets based on issues uncovered by Pellet (unknown references, cities that were missing "_City" when referenced by markets or with other slight changes in their names, a couple of duplicates, etc.)</li>

                    <li>preliminary version of the market individuals, plus loading it into an all file for testing</li>
                    <li>manual updates to municipalities to eliminate duplicates (e.g., St. Peter Port and Saint Peter Port) and add synonyms as appropriate, encoding issues present in the source file (e.g., Washington_new_York --&gt; Washington_New_York), change New_Jersey to Summit, etc.</li>

                    <li>added business day adjustment code</li>
                    <li>added business center to exchange definitions to test reasoning</li>
                    <li>modified approach to representing cities as parts of subdivisions rather than as subdivisions of subdivisions to get desired reasoning results</li>
                    <li>initial pass at encoding FpML business centers, starting with those in the U.S.</li>
                    <li>revised the definition of holding company to be a child of functional business entity rather than business, which is more appropriate given the function of a holding company</li>
                    <li>revised business dates to allow the property, has business center, to be used by more than the class called business day adjustment; revised the definition of business day adjustment to allow for the same adjustment to apply to multiple business centers (also agrees with the FpML specification); added a new ontology called business centers in FBC to support the set of FpML business centers, required for specifying the business center in which a given exchange operates</li>
                    <li>added general holding company to certain organization definitions</li>
                    <li>created the notion of a generic holding company, needed to represent the structures present in the various exchange corporate hierarchies</li>
                    <li>modified the relationship between market segment and the operating level market it is a part of; changed the reference from operatesInCity to operatesInMunicipality (strings to things) to allow us to reference FpML business centers</li>
                    <li>see prior comment re: definitions, the addition of New York Stock Exchange LLC, etc.</li>

                    <li>deprecated the class called "market" and made market a synonym of exchange; added exchanges to the example exchanges and markets in the US</li>
                    <li>corrected prefix for hasWebsite</li>
                    <li>minor revisions to the markets ontology to better reflect the standard; introduction of individuals defining the NYSE as an example</li>
                    <li>add support for ISO 10383 Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC) - model only, not including individuals</li>
                    <li>0 - made having a notional step schedule optional on an interest rate swap leg to cover the simpler cases where that level of complexity is not required; the notional is already available at the leg level to support calculation of a basic payment</li>
                    <li>02 - added support for NAICS and SIC codes (model only, not individuals) for use in several PoCs (CFTC, Wells Fargo, etc.)</li>

                    <li>SEC-44 - eliminated registration requirement, which would not be useful operationally aside from during the process of issuing a security (where there is still such a concept), and did not have sufficient semantics to warrant the cycle it introduced into the ontology</li>

                    <li>SEC-51 - eliminated restriction with respect to securities tax treatment in SecuritiesExt, which is largely about settlement, but where the tax details available in the tax treatment ontology were overly simplified and insufficient to provide utility; an independent effort with respect to taxation generally is needed eventually, once the FIBO community determines that it is a priority.</li>
                    <li>SEC-51 - eliminated securities tax treatment, which was tiny, overly simplified, and not very useful in general once references to it were eliminated</li>
                    <li>SEC-43 - eliminated numerous duplicate concepts and properties from LoansEvents and replaced them with their equivalents from released ontologies</li>
