          FIBO is being developed in a continuous process by
          <a href="working-group.html#fibo-working-groups">
            FIBO Content Teams (FCT) </a
          >. To serve the wide array of users, FIBO is published quarterly on
          this website as <a href="products.html">a variety of products</a> in
          file formats and dialects ranging from HTML to JSON-LD. All are
          generated, or derived from, the
          <a href="fibo_owl.html">FIBO OWL</a> system of record using the
          Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology in a continuous development
          process governed by automation including the Council-developed open
          source RDF ToolKit, GitHub, Jenkins, SourceTree, and a number of wikis
          for collaboration.
        </h2>

        <h3>Build, Test, Deploy, Maintain Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          FIBO is viewed as being very similar to the build of a complex,
          open-source software system. Ontologies are treated in the same way as
          "sources" like Java or C++ with the same challenges, such as managing
          dependencies and merging differences. Modern software engineering
          principles are therefore being applied to the process of building FIBO
          ontologies including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous
          Integration and Continuous Improvement. Additional principles specific
          to ontology development include adherence to modeling policies and
          best practices, testing for logical consistency, and testing for
          deductive closure. These practices are highly dependent on automation
          to merge Build, Test, Deploy, and Maintain into a continuous process.
          The orchestration of all the builds is done by an open-source
          Continuous Integration platform called
          <a href="https://jenkins.edmcouncil.org">Jenkins</a>. For every change
          in any branch in the
          <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo"
            >GitHub based git-repository</a
          >
          (accessible for members only) that contains all the source OWL
          documents, Jenkins will start the so-called "ontology-publisher" which
          is a program that executes fully automated "Build", "Test" and
          "Deployment" end-to-end in sequential stages. Deployment in our case
          is also often called "Publish" because it means that the final version
          is published for the general public on this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          The FIBO is a grand vision; it is a standard that will be used across
          the financial industry for decades. It will grow and adapt as the
          years go by, and the user demands change. It is therefore crucial that
          the FIBO Build, Test, Deploy, and Maintain process have clear and
          unambiguous goals expressed below.
        </p>

        <h5>Build</h5>
        <p>
          Build is the process of fleshing out FIBO as an RDF/OWL model using
          W3C Standards. FIBO source files are maintained in
          <a href="https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo"
            >a private GitHub repository</a
          >
          where the end results of the build process and published on this
          website (see <a href="products.html"> all FIBO products </a>). FIBO
          can be seen as a "product family" where each of the products in that
          family is generated with an automated process, which is "the build"
          that's being done by "the ontology-publisher". So all products, like
          the <a href="vocabulary.html">FIBO Vocabulary</a>, are all derived
          from the original OWL source files that reside in the GitHub
          repository (the up-to-date version of FIBO OWL can be downloaded
          <a href="fibo_owl.html">here</a>).
        </p>

        <h5>Test</h5>
        <p>
          Test includes unit tests, integration tests, "hygiene tests" and
          instance data tests that are automatically run against the ontologies
          and related artifacts to ensure conformance to requirements.
        </p>
        <h5>Deployment</h5>
        <p>
          Deployment for FIBO began when an initial FIBO Conceptual Ontology
          (BCO) began to be formed in 2008 by a team of Subject Matter Experts.
          FIBO is being used in the industry today. Examples can be found here
          and here. At this writing, FIBO deployment includes popular
          <a href="fibo_owl.html">OWL formats</a>,
          <router-link :to="{ path: router('vocabulary') }">SKOS</router-link>,
          <a href>a Data Dictionary</a>,
          <a href> a Natural Language Glossary </a>,
          <a href>
            UML conforming to the Semantic Modeling for Information Federation
            (SMIF) specification </a
          >, <a href>FIBOPedia</a> and <a href>Linked Data Fragments</a>. Within
          the industry, FIBO as OWL or any of its derived products such as the
          glossary and the data dictionary could be used as the basis for a
          semantic graph database (aka RDF database or triple store) or any
          other type of database, be integrated with reasoners, be offered as a
          web service, or within a service, or some other particular
          architecture. In fact, FIBO is the ideal core set of ontologies for
          any financial institution that operates an Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
        </p>
        <h5>Maintenance</h5>
        <p>
          Maintenance is a continuous process where the FIBO GitHub Development
          Repository is central. All
          <a href="working-group.html">FIBO Content Teams (FCTâ€™s)</a> apply
          changes to this git repository that are documented in
          <a href="https://jira.edmcouncil.org">JIRA</a>. For each discussed and
          approved JIRA-based change request, there can be one or more
          "committed changes" to that git repository where each series of
          changes triggers the build process on Jenkins. Production-FIBO is the
          tested, vetted version and is published quarterly. Development-FIBO is
          published as the content is added and tested. FIBO automation extends
          opportunities to all FIBO participants in the industry for both fixes
          and enhancements.
