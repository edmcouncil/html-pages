        <h2>
          The FIBO ontology is best viewed using a dedicated ontology tool. We
          include instructions here for three popular tools,
          <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a>,
          <a
            href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/"
            >TopBraid Composer</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/cameo-concept-modeler-plugin"
          >
            CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler) </a
          >. For each of these tools, the <i>Production</i> and
          <i>Development</i> versions of FIBO are available. See below for
          detailed instructions for loading FIBO in each of these tools.
        </h2>

        <h3>Using FIBO</h3>
        <p>
          The FIBO Ontology is available online using the
          <a
            href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/follow-your-nose.html"
          >
            <i>follow-your-nose</i>
          </a>
          pattern. This means that tools that use this pattern can read FIBO
          directly from the web. This ensures that you are always viewing the
          latest version of FIBO. Keep in mind, that when viewing FIBO in this
          way, that any edits you make to FIBO will only be reflected in your
          copy, and won't be saved for others to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          FIBO is also available for offline use by downloading a .zip of the
          current state. FIBO is updated every three months, so any such offline
          downloaded version will quickly be out of date.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaborations</h3>
        <p>
          The EDM Council is working in collaboration with many companies to
          offer open, easy access to FIBO content for discovery and analysis.
          Available now are:

        <h3>FIBO Quickstart</h3>
        <p>
          FIBO content is available in a single file, that can be loaded into an
          ontology tool or into a database. The
          <i>FIBO Quickstart</i> does not include all the content structuring of
          FIBO, but does include all the content. <i>FIBO Quickstart</i> is most
          appropriate for read-only applications of FIBO and for users who are
          new to FIBO and are evaluating it.
        </p>
        <h3>Using quickstart in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h3>
        <p>
          Quickstart is currently only available in

        <h3>Using FIBO online</h3>
        <p>
          FIBO is published using the Web Ontology Language (<a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/"
            >OWL</a
          >). There are several tools available, both commercial and
          open-source, that can read and edit FIBO. We provide instructions for
          the most common ones.
        </p>
        <h3>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h3>
        <div>
          Please use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 5.2 or higher.
          <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b>Recent version of Java can cause Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
            to exit with an error message (on the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; console)
            to the effect "Comparison method violates its general contract!"
            This is an incompatibiliy between Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Java,
            and has nothing to do with FIBO. If this happens, a work-around is
            to add the following to the java call line in the run.bat or run.sh
            (if you are on Windows or another platform, respectively):
          </p>
          <pre>

          <p>
            <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> is
            an open-source ontology editor that can be used to view and edit
            FIBO. Prot&eacute;g&eacute; works well in online mode, so you can
            point it to an LoadFIBO file, and it will load the rest.

            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Prot&eacute;g&eacute; will find and load all the FIBO files from the
            currently published version (for the selected version).
          </p>
          <h3>TopBraid Composer</h3>
          <p>
            At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into TopBraid Composer.
          </p>
          <h3>CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</h3>
          <p>At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into CCM.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Using FIBO offline</h3>
        Many semantic tools can read OWL files that have been downloaded to
        local storage. Here are the instructions for doing that with the most
        common tools.
        <p />
        <b>NOTE:</b> FIBO imports resources from outside of FIBO, including
        SKOS, LCC and others. These are not included in the FIBO download, and
        must be loaded dynamically from the web. Therefore, even when loading
        FIBO in "offline" mode, you must have an active internet connection.
        <p />
        <h3>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h3>

          standards bodies. When you load FIBO, all these tools will find these
          files via follow-your-nose. If you cannot reach these files on the
          omg.org web servers for any reason, you will see load errors for the
          files it couldn't find. These can be safely ignored, but you will not
          have details of the Languages, Countries and Codes available in your
          model.

        <h3>Stardog</h3>
        <a href="http://www.stardog.com/">Stardog</a> is a semantic data system
        that accommodates both RDF and OWL. Follow these steps to load FIBO into
        Stardog:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download the RDF/XML zip of the
            <a
              :href="hrefD('dev.rdf.zip', 'ontology')"
              v-on:click="outboundClick('dev.rdf.zip')"
              >Development</a
            >
            version or the
            <a
              :href="hrefP('prod.rdf.zip', 'ontology')"
              v-on:click="outboundClick('prod.rdf.zip')"
              >Production</a
            >
            version of FIBO.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the zip and extract the directory
            {{ hrefD("", "ontology").substring(1) }} which will be the subject
            of the remaining instructions
          </li>
          <li>
            Delete the files matching About*.rdf. You'll delete about 70 files
          </li>
          <li>
            Delete the files matching catalog*.xml. You'll delete about 12 files
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a grep tool (e.g. grepWin or similar) and carry out the
            following replace operation on the directory:
          </li>
          <pre>
File names matching: *.rdf
Search string: {{ hrefD("", "ontology").substring(1) }}/
Replace string: fibo/ontology/
</pre
          >
          It should make replacements in approx. 320 files.
          <li>Zip up the directory e.g. as FIBO.zip.</li>
          <li>
            Use the following command line for database dbX (you would normally
            need to add username and passwd parameters):
            <pre>stardog data add dbX FIBO.zip</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Adaptive</h3>
        To load FIBO into
        <a href="http://fibosearch.adaptive.com/">Adaptive</a> (version 8.1 or
        later), follow the first six steps under "Stardog" above. Note that even
        if you use the Development version Adaptive will indicate the status of
        each item (Release, Provisional or Informative). Then do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the file manifest.mf (from the Adaptive installation
            (a3/installation/FIBO/manifest.mf) into the zip
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Adaptive web interface select OWL Zip File Import from the
            Integrator page; select the file FIBO.zip, check the last item on
            the page Ignore Unresolved Hrefs, and Execute the import
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the previous step to re-import the file and resolve the
            references (there will still be some unresolved external references
            unless the Languages Countries and Codes ontology has been
            previously loaded. This is provided as LCC.zip in the Adaptive
            installation and is loaded in the same way)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3><a name="namespace" />Namespace prefixes in FIBO</h3>
        XML, RDF, and SPARQL all have mechanisms for recording shorthand
        versions of the long IRI names. FIBO has a standard set of prefixes for
        the resources in FIBO. These are currently incomplete but will be
        completed shortly.
        <p>
          As an assist for developers using FIBO, we provide the namespace
          prefixes in many formats,
          <a
            :href="hrefD('prefixes.fibo.ttl', 'ontology')"
            v-on:click="outboundClick('prefixes.fibo.ttl')"
          >
            prefixes.ttl (Turtle) </a
          >,
          <a
            :href="hrefD('prefixes.fibo.sq', 'ontology')"
            v-on:click="outboundClick('prefixes.fibo.sq')"
            >prefixes.sq (SPARLQ)</a
          >, and
          <a
            :href="hrefD('prefixes.fibo.csv', 'ontology')"
            v-on:click="outboundClick('prefixes.fibo.csv')"
            >prefixes.csv</a
          >.
