                                    <li>(2) from the perspective of a broker/dealer or swap execution facility, to be able to analyze and report on the derivatives they manage and/or own, and the counterparties to those instruments, whether they are on their own books or those of their clients, and report on them to an SDR, </li>

                                    <li>(3) from the perspective of an SDR, exchange, clearing house, or other recipient, to receive reports that are provided in a common, standardized representation that makes them easier to ingest, and to be able to analyze and report on the derivatives for which they receive reports in an accurate and timely way, including analysis of the counterparties to the instruments included in those reports, and</li>

                                    <li>(4) from the perspective of a regulator or other organization receiving information from a variety of sources that are not aligned with one another, to have the ability to map that information to a common vocabulary to facilitate analysis and ultimately to have a common framework for reporting that would enable understanding as well as reporting from third parties.</li>

The frequency depends on the kind of information reported. These reports have all different forms and formats that are not normalized, and the data is difficult to compare as a consequence. </p>

                                <p class="text">Note that as we move towards distributed ledger technology, having standard language for reporting purposes could extend to smart contracts which would be more effective than use of legacy approaches to such reporting.</p>

                                This use case involves specifying the concepts and terminology required for reporting on derivatives, both generally, across all kinds of derivatives, and specific to the most common derivatives in the marketplace to facilitate reporting about them. The level of detail depends on the specific reporting requirements, outlined in the usage scenarios, below. Initial targets include swaps - interest rate and commodity swaps, options, futures and forwards, and various asset-backed securities. Note that transformations from/to the ESMA / ISO 20022 format in the EU (or at least, CPMI IOSCO), and to the CFTC format in the US, may be needed to support this kind of reporting, and possibly the ACTUS contract definitions of some of the terms of these contracts. These various formats all lead to some understanding of what terms should be included to identify derivative contracts and what variants should be included in order to provide basic coverage.

                                Counterparty exposure is one aspect of managing risk related to derivatives reporting, as one of many requirements related to regulatory reporting on risk. It involves knowing who your counterparties are and rolling up the risk across legal entities under various scenarios - based on parameters required for stress testing. Clearly organizations need to understand their counterparty exposure regardless of the reporting requirement. Companies have many subsidiaries and complex relationships, and understanding total exposure across legal entities can be difficult at best. The goal is to show how to use FIBO to demonstrate total exposure to a given counterparty.

                                <p class="text">Regulators are concerned with understanding the networks of counterparties, whereas in this case, typically an institution would act as one counterparty to the instruments on their books. Exposure, in this case, is intended to be from the perspective of a given counterparty, such as a majority stakeholder, minority stakeholder, or other owner, including a specific institution. Understanding exposure involves percent ownership, what the risk in a given subsidiary might be, what happens if the subsidiary goes under but the parent does not, backing / recourse behind such situations, etc.</p>

                                <p class="text">Another concern is to understand what is going on between counterparties, between traders, and so forth, where an institution or trader might be part of a network, especially in cases where a given trader uses multiple accounts to avoid certain reporting requirements, for example. Institutions need to understand the networks that their traders participate in as well, to make sure that they are not exceeding position limits or exposure requirements. They also need to understand counterparties from an ownership and control perspective to understand overall exposure to a higher-level organization.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>counterparty - 'in the event that a contract identifies either party to that contract as being the principal, this is the other party to that contract'

                                    </li>
                                    <li>exposure - 'the extent to which an individual or organization is unprotected and open to damage, danger, risk of suffering a loss, or uncertainty'</li>
                                    <li>financial exposure - 'the extent to which an individual or organization is open to risk of suffering a loss in a transaction, or with respect to some investment or set of investments, e.g., some holding; the amount one stands to lose in that transaction or investment' The latter, financial exposure, is what we are talking about with regards to this use case, and includes obligations as well as investments (perhaps the definition should be amended to include that).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="text">The use case that consists of analyzing, assessing or measuring “counterparty exposure”, is -- owing to the variety of dimensions and facets of both of the two primary domains that make up the topic (i.e., “counterparties” and “exposure”) – itself a potentially very robust and broad use case by virtue of the large number of cross-products of the dimensions and facets inherent with the combination of those two principle domains.</p>

                                <p class="text">In order to better manage the elaboration of this use case, it would be useful to understand the types, and depth of detail, regarding the dimensions and facets that comprise “counterparty exposure”. Two approaches to the effective examination of counterparty exposure use case could be taken: (1) in which the number of factors and dimensions are purposely constrained in order to be able to feasibly consider a broad and inclusive treatment of counterparty exposure by limiting the depth of the classifications, or (2) a more narrowly scoped use case that would consider, in greater detail and depth, a specific example of counterparty exposure that would be limited to a particular type of counterparty and a particular type of exposure.</p>

                                <p class="text">Given the definition of “counterparty exposure in a derivatives trading network”, this use case is perhaps best described as something between (1) and (2) above, having both some broader aspects as well some more narrow ones.</p>

                                <p class="text">What are the appropriate dimensions and facets of the ‘counterparty’ domain to consider for this use case? These could perhaps be first grouped into what might be called ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ dimensions: the ‘horizontal’ aspect pertaining to the classification of different types of counterparties, and the ‘vertical’ one that considers where in a hierarchy of related counterparties does a counterparty sit? </p>

                                <p class="text">Given the ‘derivatives trading’ sector of the use case, the type of counterparties that would be relevant would consist primarily of “central banks”, “commercial banks”, “clearing organizations”, “municipal jurisdictions” and “private companies”, since any of those entities could be counterparties to derivative transactions. “Retail consumers” would not be included since derivative contracts almost never involve individuals. Furthermore, if the focus is truly on counterparty exposure (as in, risk), then one would conceivably omit regulatory reporting, as the focus and objective of regulatory reporting is primarily on systemic risk and financial system stability. </p>

                                <p class="text">If we consider the ‘vertical’ (i.e., hierarchical or relationship) counterparty dimension, then the aggregation of counterparty exposure up organizational hierarchies (whether private or public) could conceivably bring some measure of counterparty exposure at an aggregate or systemic level into consideration. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, however, since a network or systemic measure of counterparty exposure is a very different type of metric than, say, the set of counterparty exposures of a single entity vis-a-vis its immediate counterparties.</p>

                                <p class="text">When it comes to the “exposure” topic itself, the classification dimensions and facets become much more varied and numerous. </p>

                                <p class="text">There is, of course, the exposure to a single derivative contract. Since derivative contracts are inherently customizable, there are also a substantial number of different derivative contract types. Furthermore, an entity can have many, many derivative contracts with another single entity (consider those between one large commercial bank and another large commercial bank). </p>

                                <p class="text">And, as is the widespread practice in measures of exposures (and credit risk), factors such as the related industry sector, geopolitical domicile, currency, market reference rates, and/or interest reference rates that are contained in derivative contracts -- and, importantly, properties of the counterparty on the other side of the contract -- are all relevant to counterparty exposure.</p>

                                <p class="text">Hence, “counterparty exposure in a derivatives trading network” is a fairly robust use case, even with limitations and restrictions.</p>
