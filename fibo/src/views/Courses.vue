            Businesses today need to have comprehensive control and
            understanding of the data both within the enterprise and from
            outside. Regulatory pressure in many industries requires that an
            enterprise be able to find all relevant data about customers,
            products, business relations, and in fact, any aspect of the
            business quickly and accurately. Advances in data analytics have
            shown that the more meaningful data an enterprise can bring to bear,
            the more accurately business drivers can be predicted. For this
            reason, many businesses are migrating from viewing their enterprise
            information as a collection of data to viewing it as an ongoing
            graph of meaningful knowledge.

          <p>
            <em>Knowledge Graph and FIBO Course</em> is just part of our
            educational offer. Our full offer of courses covers different areas
            of Knowledge Graph Industry. These are shown below as a mind map
            that interlinks different learning topics.

          <p>
            The map is split into six course modules, which are then split into
            smaller training blocks. Obviously, the modules and the blocks are
            not independent from one another as some require knowledge provided
            by others. Therefore the map shows which modules and blocks depend
            on which, i.e., it shows what you need to master before you can dig
            into something else.
