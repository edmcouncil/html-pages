          FIBO is published in a way that allows users from financial
          institutions, regulators, or even research groups to download and use
          a variety of artifacts. But people who plan to contribute to FIBO will
          have to deal with the FIBO source and will need to know how to edit
          it. They will also need to know their way around GitHub and understand
          how to carry out actions such as <i>fork, pull requests</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>FIBO Sources and Products</h3>
        <p class="text">
          FIBO is developed using a familiar process from software engineering,
          in which a product is developed using source code, which is compiled
          into a product. In most software settings, source code is written in a
          programming language (e.g., Java, C++, or Python), which is compiled
          into executable code for the product. FIBO is developed in the same
          way, but the product code is not 'executable' in any normal sense of
          the word. In fact, the FIBO products can be published in the same
          language as the source (i.e., OWL), so it is easy to be confused when
          looking at any particular file, whether you are looking at source or
          product. Management of the FIBO development process follows
          conventional software engineering practices, so the difference between
          source and product is clear when you think about the process.
        </p>

        <ul class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            FIBO sources are managed in GitHub, in RDF/XML format. The FIBO
            products are published in many formats and serializations (RDF/XML,
            ttl, json-ld, csv, MS Excel(tm), SKOS, SMIF, etc.) on the
            <router-link class="" :to="{ path: router() }"
              >http://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo</router-link
            >
            web site.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sources are edited by developers using development tools (which
            can range in sophistication from text editing tools to elaborate
            WYSIWYG environments). Products are automatically produced from an
            integrated testing environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            While it is possible to perform certain tests on sources (in most
            languages, these tests are largely syntactic; in the case of OWL,
            they can include some semantic completeness and logical correctness
            tests), official software testing for the development process is
            done on the products. Just as in classical software engineering,
            this is necessary, since it is imperative that the product delivered
            to the customers has itself been tested, not just some source that
            was used in building it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The conventional
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle"
              v-on:click="
                outboundLinkClick(
                  'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle'
                )
              "
              >Software Release Cycle</a
            >
            specifies many possible stages of development for a product. In
            FIBO, we only use two of these, which we call DEVELOPMENT
            (corresponding roughly to Beta in the conventional cycle) and
            PRODUCTION (corresponding roughly to RC in the conventional cycle).
            These stages are described in more detail below as "Publication
            Maturity Levels"
          </li>
          <li>
            In conventional software development, especially when using a formal
            version control system like git, there can be many versions of the
            source code. Some versions are developing new features; some are bug
            fixes, others are experimental versions that will never move
            forward. FIBO recognizes three statuses for its source code;
            <strong>Informative</strong>, <strong>Provisional</strong>, and
            <strong>Release</strong>. These statuses are described in more
            detail below. as "Source Maturity Levels."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p class="text">
          The FIBO sources are kept in a repository on GitHub,
          <a

            >https://github.com/edmcouncil</a
          >. As is customary with GitHub, changes to FIBO are made in a fork of
          the EDMC repository, and these changes are proposed to the FIBO
          Community Group through a pull request. All FIBO Content and Tools are
          here. You will need a

        <h3>FIBO Maturity Levels</h3>
        <p class="text">
          FIBO is published in two release levels - a
          <strong><i>Production</i></strong> level, where every model has passed
          serious scrutiny for consistency, completeness and documentation, and
          a <strong><i>Development</i></strong> level, where the ontologies have
          passed only minimum scrutiny for referential consistency (basically,
          an ontology doesn't refer to things which are undefined).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          FIBO publications are built out of FIBO sources. FIBO sources have
          three levels of maturity,
          <strong><i>Informative</i></strong
          >, <strong><i>Provisional</i></strong> and
          <strong><i>Release</i></strong
          >.
        </p>

        <h5>FIBO Source Maturity Levels</h5>
        <p class="">
          <strong><i>Informative</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Informative ontologies are ones that have been considered by the FIBO
          Community but have been explicitly rejected. They are included in FIBO
          sources because they contain the target of references from Provisional
          ontologies, without which FIBO would fail the basic referential
          consistency tests. FIBO Community should consider these for
          information only, to determine the detailed meaning of the things that
          reference them. One aim of development is to replace references to
          elements in Provisional ontologies to those in Provisional or Release
          ontologies.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <strong><i>Provisional</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Provisional ontologies were developed in the early days of FIBO, and
          have not undergone the complete review required to be considered
          Release. There is a wide range of maturity that fits into Provisional;
          some have barely been reviewed, others have had a considerable review
          and are on their way to being Release.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <strong><i>Release</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Release models have undergone extensive unit and integration testing,
          and have passed the most rigorous tests for completeness, consistency,
          and correctness.
        </p>

        <h5>FIBO Publication Maturity Levels</h5>
        <p class="text">
          The FIBO publications are built from sources through a process that
          involves re-writing URIs to match publication conventions, converting
          files into multiple standard formats, and triggering derivative
          products such as the glossary and FIBO-V.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The two FIBO publication products are built by combining models from
          the source maturity levels as follows:
        </p>

        <ul class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            <i>Production</i> is made up of the <i>Release</i> sources only.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Development</i> is made up of sources from <i>Release</i>,
            <i>Provisional</i>, and <i>Informative</i> levels, all combined
            together.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">
          FIBO Community is working to move ontologies up the maturity ladder.
          Specifically, to develop Provisional ontologies to become part of the
          Release, and to remove reliance on Informative models so that they can
          be removed entirely.
        </p>

        <h5>Indication of Maturity Levels in FIBO sources</h5>
        <p class="text">
          FIBO maturity levels are indicated on an ontology basis; that is, an
          ontology has a level (Informative, Provisional, Release), not a class
          or a property (classes and properties have the maturity level of their
          containing ontology). The maturity level of an ontology is indicated
          in the ontology file itself, with a triple in RDF, e.g.,
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          <code
            >fibo-bp-iss-doc: fibo-fnd-utl-av:hasMaturityLevel
            fibo-fnd-utl-av:Provisional</code
          >
          .
        </p>
        <p class="text">The development process could go as follows:</p>
        <ul class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            A developer (in his/her local repo) changes the maturity of an
            ontology from Provisional to Release
          </li>
          <li>
            They make changes to definitions in the ontology (to classes and
            properties)
          </li>
          <li>
            They test these changes until they are satisfied that the ontology
            is ready
          </li>
          <li>
            They push the ontologies to GitHub and see what the automated tests
            say
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the previous 3 steps until the tests pass</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Contributing to FIBO</h5>
        <p class="text">
          If you want to contribute to FIBO, you'll need to do the following
          things:
        </p>
        <ol class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            Create a login for

            >, if you need to download java.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install a git client. In FIBO, we recommend Sourcetree from
            Atlassian (<a
              href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/"
              v-on:click="outboundLinkClick('https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/')"
              >https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/</a
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a "fork" of the "fibo" repository at
            <a

          </li>
          <li>
            Install FIBO serialization tools (see below). This is important so
            that your code can be compared and merged with code from other
            contributors. You cannot submit a pull request to the fibo
            repository without this step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install the local testing tools (see below). This will allow you to
            process FIBO with the most common semantic web editing tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit FIBO using the RDF/OWL editor of your choice (Protégé,
            TopBraid, MagicDraw CCM, VOM, Cognitum Fluent Editor, etc. ).
          </li>
          <li>Submit a Pull Request to the EDMCouncil.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
          You only have to do steps 1-6 once. Once you have begun contributing,
          you just repeat steps 7 and 8.
        </p>

        <h5>FIBO Serialization tools</h5>
        <p class="text">
          When you cloned your fork to your local repository, you chose a
          directory in which FIBO resides. This is your fibo installation
          directory. In order to use the FIBO Serialization tools, you will need
          two files, a pre-commit hook file and a Java application file called
          RDF Toolkit. These need to reside in a directory called /hooks under
          your local Git working directory, called .git; the instructions below
          should be followed in order to ensure that you have the latest
          versions of these files in their intended locations.
        </p>
        <ul class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            In your FIBO installation directory, there is a directory called
            “.git”, and a folder in there called “hooks”. This folder should
            have been created for you when you cloned the repository; if not,
            you can initialize your repository from the Git command line by
            changing directory to your fibo installation directory and typing:
            git init
          </li>
          <li>
            The Git command line can be run from within the SourceTree tool by
            selecting "Open in terminal" from the Actions menu. Alternatively,
            you may set up a Git shell environment – see separate page ‘<a
              href="https://wiki.edmcouncil.org/display/INFRA/Setting+up+a+Git+Shell"
              v-on:click="
                outboundLinkClick(
                  'https://wiki.edmcouncil.org/display/INFRA/Setting+up+a+Git+Shell'

            >’ for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Running the initialization command should ensure that your .git
            environment exists and that it includes the /hooks directory. This
            does not automatically install or update the two files that you need
            to have in place for the Serializer to work. These are:
            <ul class="space-at-top">
              <li>pre-commit (no file extension)</li>
              <li>rdf-toolkit.jar</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            These files are updated from time to time so it is recommended that
            you re-download these directly from the links below before
            proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy the file

              "
              >pre-commit</a
            >
            to your hooks directory (use right-click on the link and select the
            save option). Make sure that the name of the file is just
            pre-commit; your browser might want to append a suffix like .txt to
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit this pre-commit file to point to your Java JRE/JDK. To do this,
            open the pre-commit file in a text editor and search for
            “JAVA_HOME”. Edit the directory after JAVA_HOME= to point to the
            location of your Java 8 (a.k.a version 1.8) or higher JRE/JDK, and
            save it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy the file
            <a

        </ul>

        <p class="text">
          Once you have installed these two files, every commit you do will
          re-write your RDF/OWL files in a consistent way that can be compared
          and merged with work done by other FIBO collaborators.

            <i>&amp;fibo-be-le-lp;isCapableOf</i> . Save the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit the file to your branch. In Sourcetree, select
            LegalPersons.rdf in the staging area, then "Stage Selected", then
            click "Commit" in the upper left. Enter a comment (e.g., "Test
            serialization"), and click "commit" in the lower right. Make sure
            that the toggle "Push changes immediately ..." is unselected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examine LegalPersons.rdf, It should have changed since you saved in
            a few steps ago. Verify that your new line, with
            <i>&amp;fibo-be-le-lp;isCapableOf</i> now appears before the line
            with <i>fibo-be-le-lp;isRecognizedIn</i> .
          </li>
          <li>
            Return to the branch you were working on before this test (in
            Sourcetree, double-click in the left pane on, e.g., "master").
          </li>
          <li>
            Delete branch SerializerTest. (in Sourcetree, right-click on the
            branch in the left pane, and select "delete". You might have to
            enable "Force delete" to make it work correctly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Local Testing tools</h5>
        <p class="text">
          FIBO developers are accustomed to using desktop tools like Protégé,
          TopBraid Composer, VOM, and MagicDraw/CCM. These tools include a
          variety of tests that experienced users rely on to determine the
          correctness of their models. In order to satisfy themselves that the
          ontologies are correct, they need to be able to test the same
          configuration of ontologies that will be published (i.e., Production
          and Development, see above).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In order to make this possible on their local machine, developers need
          to be able to load just the Release ontologies (from their current
          testbed). This is done by creating a file called AboutProd.ttl (also
          AboutProd.rdf). Developers working with the pre-release files will
          want to load all FIBO files; this is done with a file called
          AboutDev.ttl (also AboutDev.rdf). These "About" files load the same
          files that are loaded by the publishing process of FIBO (for Prod and
          Dev, respectively).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Some tools (e.g., Protégé and CCM) use catalog files to manage the
          file loading. These can also be automatically created.
        </p>
        <p class="text">To perform local testing, do the following steps:</p>
        <ol class="nolmal-line-height">
          <li>
            Make sure you can run a Bash shell. Windows now has a native Bash
            shell (Windows 10). One is also available as part of SourceTree.
          </li>
          <li>
            Download the FIBO tools from

          <li>
            Create a catalog file by running the shell command
            <code>./createCatalog.sh</code> (optional, for use with Protege or
            CCM only)
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the About files by running the shell command
            <code>./createAbout.sh</code> (this can take a while)
          </li>
          <li>
            Load AboutProd.ttl (.rdf) or AboutDev.ttl (.rdf) to perform local
            tests.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Step 3 needs to be done again whenever you create a new file or change
          the base URI of a file.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Step 4 needs to be done again whenever you change the maturity level
          or base URI of a file, add a new file or delete a file.
        </p>

        <h5>Automated Testing</h5>
        <p class="text">
          When FIBO is 'pushed' to a registered fork, a Jenkins job runs to
          perform standard tests. These tests are strict and comprehensive for
          the Production release of FIBO and are quite lax for the Development
          release of FIBO (for Development, they just check that nothing is
          referenced unless it is defined)
        </p>

        <h5>Automated Publication</h5>
        <p class="text">
          When a pull request results in a new version of FIBO in the EDMC
          repository, a series of publication processes are performed according
          to the FIBO publication policy.
