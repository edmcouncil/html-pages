<p class="text">EDMC recognizes the urgent need to bring this new architecture and approach to its members and beyond. In consultations with various members, analysts, and software vendors, we have launched the Open Knowledge Graph Lab (OKGL). OKGL mission is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>(1) Establish and grow a global community of Knowledge Graph Consumers, makers of technology, enablers such as management consultancies and Systems Integrators and industry standards bodies to promote enterprise-wide adoption of this technology.</li>
    <li>(2) Develop open-source, re-usable, Plug and Play knowledge Graphs of high mutualized value via a Cloud marketplace with Sandbox to test drive use-cases in an accelerated manner.</li>
    <li>(3) Provide training and mentorship to participants on Knowledge Graph architectures, supporting Ontology development while promoting the adoption of relevant industry standards.</li>
    <li>(4) Develop and provide industry benchmarks to demonstrate adoption across various industries.</li>            
</ul>

<h4>OKGL roll-out</h4>
  
<h5>Q3, 2020: Phase 1 – Training, Ontology Reviews, POV on Graph Architectures and Awareness</h5>
<p class="text">OKGL is already serving early-adopter customers with Knowledge Graph training, Ontology reviews, and ability to refine domain-specific Ontologies further. Where applicable, OKGL is also leveraging its FIBO Ontology for broader Fraud and Risk use cases.</p>

<h5>Q3-4, 2020: Phase 2 – Mutualized value Knowledge Graph Development and Socialization</h5> 
<p class="text">Establish a working group to identify and develop 1st mutualized value Knowledge Graph use case. Early candidates include AML, Fraud leveraging FIBO standards. This working group will also develop the prototype to demonstrate how AML Knowledge Graph will help address the challenges in this space more efficiently than current techniques.</p>

<h5>Q4, 2020-Q1, 2021: Phase 3 – Additional Knowledge Graphs, Cloud Sandbox availability</h5>
<p class="text">Due to intense focus on the Covid-19 crisis, 2nd working group will focus on developing the Covid-19 Knowledge Graph. Additional workgroups on use cases such as supply-chain and workplace and worker safety are some additional candidates.</p>


<h4>Cloud Sandbox</h4>
<p class="text">OKGL will host a Cloud Sandbox that will serve as a testbed for Consumers to develop prototypes and performance metrics rapidly. This capability will be enabled by technology vendors and consultancies.</p> 

<h4>Partnership</h4>
<p class="text">OKGL will also establish partnerships with other ecosystems such as R3 and hashgraph to integrate the power of Blockchain and Hashgraph architectures and techniques to further enhance the value of Knowledge Graph powered Insights. </p>
