<p>We start building the automotive ontology from tranlating the auto extenion of schema.org into OWL. </p>



            
<h4><span>From auto.schema.org to the automotive ontology</span></h4>

<ul>
    <li>rdfs:subClassOf is used in schema.org.</li>
    <li>schema:domainIncludes and schema:rangeIncludes values are converted into rdfs:domain and rdfs:range values using owl:unionOf to capture the multiplicity of values.</li>
    <!--<li>https://schema.org/Date has been translated into xsd:dateTime.</li>
    <li>https://schema.org/Text has been translated into xsd:string</li>
    <li>schema:Number has been translated into xsd:decimal</li>
    <li>schema:URL has been translated into xsd:anyURI</li>
    <li>Schema properties that have classes and data types in the range have been duplicated into two see e.g. bodyType and bodyType2.</li>-->
    <li>schema.org does not have restrictions. "min 0" restricitons involving realtion R have been added to a class C, if C was a domain of R.</li>
</ul>
