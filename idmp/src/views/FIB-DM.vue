            Midsize EDM Council members want to use the industry standard, but
            many don’t have ontology tooling, databases, and human expertise
            in-house yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large financial institutions want to leverage their customized
            ontologies for the whole enterprise beyond the Semantic Center of
            Excellence (CoE).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The FIBO development team created FIBO-derived glossaries and
          dictionaries to help. However, data architects still have to manually
          transcribe diagrams into their data modeling tool and copy &amp; paste
          definitions. The Financial Industry Business Data Model supplements
          the EDMC ontology-derived formats.

          CODT derives FIB-DM entities from FIBO classes, associative entities
          from object properties, relationships from the domain, range, and
          class restrictions, and attributes from data properties. The data
          model entities contain the complete FIBO documentation and lineage
          with the source FIBO class URI link.

          We believe that the ontology-derived data model is also more
          comprehensive, modern, and conceptually sound, thanks to the

          supporting the content groups.

            As a FIB-DM architect, you can easily learn OWL and ontology tooling
            because you recognize the familiar concepts and design patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a business user or analyst, you find the FIB-CM concept maps
            intuitive and far less complicated than graphs and data models.

          <li>
            As an ontologist, you reverse-engineer in-house data models into
            RDF/OWL, accelerating your Enterprise Ontology design for Knowledge
            Graph and other use cases. In addition, you generate data models for
            conventional data architecture.
